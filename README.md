# PkgSync
> **todo:** add a video here

A program to help you keep track of packages explicitly installed in your system intuitively. Works on Arch Linux.

## Building
The only dependencies are `rust`, `cargo` and `GNUmake`.
```
make
sudo make install
```

## Warning
This is my first Rust project, having **no** prior experience with the language. I literally guessed the syntax and made this in one night. It's not unsafe to use or anything, just the source code might be a bit messy :\)
